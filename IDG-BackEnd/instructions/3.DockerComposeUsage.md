# How to Use Docker Compose to Start Your Container

Instead of running Docker commands manually, you can use Docker Compose to manage your containers more easily. Follow these steps:

---

## 1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` File

In your project root directory, create a file named `docker-compose.yml` with the following content (customize as needed):

```yaml
# version: "3.9"
services:
  app:
    build: .
    image: <your-dockerhub-username>/my-app:latest
    container_name: my-app-container
    ports:
      - 8000:80
      - 5173:5173
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/html
```

---

## 2. Start the Container with Docker Compose

Open a terminal in your project directory and run:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

This command builds the image (if needed) and starts the container in detached mode.

---

## 3. Stop and Remove the Container

To stop and remove the container, run:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

---

## 4. View Logs

To see the logs from your container, use:

```sh
docker-compose logs
```

---

Using Docker Compose simplifies container management and makes it easy to start, stop, and configure your application.
